      "sorry about the title. . . i couldn't help myself . . . . anyways, let me begin by saying there are few things more subjective than a fragrance, especially a woman's fragrance. i'm a woman (and proud) and i know how finicky we can be. but that's besides the point, let's focus on stella.instead of expressing a biased opinion i'm going take a objective pov. i'm going to explain the ingredients . . .yes you heard me . .the ingredients . . .sure . .the /are/ listed here, but do you really know what they are . . .i'm not going to explain them all, but hopefully enough to help you understand the science of the scent as well as the actually scent itself. h'okay, here we go!*centaurea cyanus = the common cornflower aka \"bluebottle\" aka the buttonierre flower*squalene (which may or may not come from the bladder of a shark {most likely its just synthetically created now}) = a natural moisturizer. it penetrates the skin quickly, but does not leave that nasty greasy feeling (not to mention the fact that squalene blends well with other oils and vitamins)*glyercin is used to preserve the essential oils and chemicals from the herbs (aka the flowers) . . .it may also be used as a bonding agent.*prunus amygdalus dulcis aka \"sweet almond\" (think amaretto) is used to add a sweetness to the fragrance (durrr)*cetyl alcohol is the surfacant which is a wetting agent that allows easier spreading*cetyl palmitate is basically just an compound found in most oils . .*gylceryl stearate is basically a lubricant . .it's used in all types of cosmetics . ..mostly it comes from animal fat but it also can be obtainesd from some unsaturated vegetable oils (i'd check up on that . . .if you are an animal rights person or whatever . . )*polysorbate 60 is used to solubilize essential oils into water-based products . . .*as for dimethicone is mostly used is usually listed as a \"skin protectant\" whatever that means  . . . .*jojoba oil is an exceptional moisturizer and more importantly, it's used in a lot of cosmetics as a replacement for whale oil (some scientists even claim it's superior to whale oil)*tocopherol contains vitamin e which is considered good for the skin :-)*shea butter is said to be a good skin softener . . .*triethanolamine = a ph balancer (makes sure the perfume/lotion/whatever isn't too acidic*citronellol is an oil found in roses . . .it should be avoided by those who tend to have perfume allergies*linalool is a typical chemical found in many flowers and plants . .it also contains vitamin e which is good . . .*lavandula stoechas is simply a type of lavander. it is commonly used in air fresheners and insecticides . . .*rosa gallica = a type of rose*limomene = a hydrocarbon; you can thank the citris note in fragrance to this*there are multiple other flowers added to the mix so i would l put this fragrance in the flowery category . .as for some beaty tips considering this scent i'd say it's of moderate strength, it lasts around 8 hours or so, it's a casual scent . .not to fancy, but definitely far from plain; and i'd doubt a kid/teen would like the scent. it takes a mature nose to adjust to the kalaedoscope (sp?) of smells that is stella.\n",

      "i have changed an earlier review on this product. my fault, i was a newbie to the reviewer world and i failed to realize the importance of tried and true testing. 160 reviews later i get it. it took 3 different products and a very specific combination of products to achieve the texture that i was looking for.me - 28 this month. v shaped hairline. hairstyle - long enough to run a comb through, usually let it grow for 1.5 months then cut back.the biotin b-complex conditioner is a daily counterbalance to the biotin shampoo. the shampoo is harsh but effective. it leaves my hair feeling like a brillo pad and the conditioner helps break that apart. when used together the signs of balding are significantly reduced (seeing your scalp through the hair). also, my hairstyle is a lot easier and fuller looking (messy and pushed up in the front).even with the combination i found my hair needing a break from the two. i use organix coconut milk conditioner once a week to soften my hair. this is an extremely effective break.the proportions i use suit my taste. the appearance of thickness is all i really care about. i know i'll go bald eventually which is why i'm putting the work in the gym now. you have to be in shape if you're bald :)\n",

      "6/8/2013, first review: i thought to review this product as time goes on. i've only been using it for a week, so i do not expect to see hair growth at this point.  it's good to note that i'm 42 years old, w/disturbing hair loss.the bottles are small so i'm not using it carelessly. the smell is not flowery & fun, but it's more medicinal in scent, not overpowering. the shampoo lathers if you work at it, & it's a low lather rather than a high and luffy one. i rub it gently on my scalp & throughout my hair. if scrub too hard, i'll lose more hair. :( i am washing my hair every day, where i used to wash every other day. the conditioner does not lather.  it's more of a cream that i rub gently onto wet hair. my hair feels sort of weighty as i wash it & i think that i'm going to have a bad hair day ahead of me, but after styling, it's actually soft, manageable, not weighty! after washing, i wrap in a towel for about 5 minutes, apply finesse styling mousse, let my brown curls air dry. sometimes a touch of hairspray but most days, not. with the thick feel in the shower, i am surprised that it's not weighted down after styling. so, i'll keep on trying this for 3 months. i'll try to remember to update if i see a difference. feel free to ask me questions.**it's important to mention that along w/the shampoo & conditioner, i'm taking, maxi hair supplements.  my dr. was pleased w/the ingredients of the shamp, cond and supplements. i use the supplements in place of a multi so i also take omega 3 & calcium citrate w/ d3. (as per dr).**6/27/2013 - although there is no new hair growth, i've noticed that i'm losing less hair when i wash & style!  it's enough for me to notice & enough for me to keep going w/ this trial. 19 days in, w/ consistent use of shamp/cond & maxi hair, my hair is smoother, softer, shinier stronger, doesn't have a bad smell, still not weighty & continues to be manageable. i feel like whatever residue was clogging my hair is out. my hope is that this is the case for my scalp & maybe, just maybe, i'll see some new sprouts. a girl can dream. :)6/30/2013 - could it be?  new hair?  will keep you posted.  i see three short hairs poking through!  i should also note that my nails need to be trimmed more often than ever, and i have to shave, (legs, underarms), more frequently!  i suspect this would be from the internal good i'm getting from the maxi-hair supplement.7/21/2013 - yes!  still losing less hair, and there is new hair growth in little stray spots.  my nails, which i keep short, need to be cut once every week to 10 days as opposed to once every 3 or more weeks!  i rcvd two complements on my hair this past week, about how shiny &healthy; it looks!  i remain faithful to the products, using them every day as recommended.9/21/13 - important update.  it seems that with months of use, this product is great for clearing up any residue on my scalp, but it is drying out my hair.  i have to rotate my use of this and the conditioner.  it's stripping the oils from my hair.  i will still use the shampoo and conditioner, but may just use it once a week.  will keep updating.  i did notice that for the past two weeks, when i use the products, my scalp gets just a little itchy.  that also indicates to me that the residue blocking my pores may be cleared up!  that is the good part!  so, i will be using the maxi hair daily as bottle recommends, but will limit the use of the shampoo and conditioner.\n",

      "i was so very disappointed with my purchase of the avalon thickening shampoo and conditioner. i had such high hopes, but in only two shampooings, my hair was noticeably stripped of oils, had that &#34;squeaky clean&#34; feeling you get when using a very harsh product, and it became dry and brittle. it started looking very dull. they use many products that have an oil stripping effect on the hair, like orange oil and lemon oil. you might think because it says, 'oil' that it might add to your hair's shine, but these are ingredients in industrial strength degreasers. this product only damaged my hair. avalon is only 70% organic and it had a rather unpleasant smell to me. rather like mosquito repellant or dish soap. using a harsh product like this is very detrimental for your hair. i know that a lot of people will be drawn to avalon because of the low price, but if it drastically stripped my extremely oily hair in two shampoos, i can't imagine what it might do to yours. although my hair is very fine, so perhaps ethnic girls, and women with coarser hair might benefit? i honestly wouldn't recommend it. i'd rather see people get something that will improve their self-esteem immediately, rather than give them new problems to worry about.in desperation i purchased the more expensive just naturals system for thinning hair and believe me, it blows avalon out of the water. in just one shampoo my hair regained it's texture and became so silky it felt like asian hair. i can't stop touching my hair now and i feel so much more confident. they use incredible ingredients that greatly benefit people with hair loss due to hormonal issues, or who have an increase in dht. you do pay more than double for that shampoo, but having something that supports your hair, improves the texture, and smells fantastic, was worth it to me. i'm now quite confident in what i'm using and plan to go on using it, regardless of the cost. i'd pay 5x what i'm paying for it now, i love it so much. and their treatment spray is oil based. i use the system twice a day and i'm shocked at how long it is lasting. it has truly been an excellent investment.i would recommend that you shampoo and condition your hair twice a day if you want to see regrowth with any system. this is because one application of shampoo with dht-fighting ingredients, can only do so much. your body is constantly generating new hormones and new dht. by helping to combat it twice a day, you have a better chance of seeing results sooner. this is coming from a 36 year old woman who has been fighting repeated hair loss due to hormonal imbalance from 16 on. once a day just never cut it for me. using a leave on treatment like just naturals has overnight, can also work wonders. i use it during the day too if i'm not going out.i hope this helps you recover your hair, and your self-esteem, a little faster and more efficiently. :o)\n"

      "i have a disability which causes me to drop things often. i wanted to get rid of all the bottles and tubes in my tub as they were forever landing by my feet causing a risk for me to fall. this unit is superb. it was easy to install if you follow the clear instructions. once up it takes 24 hours for the glue to cure and then you can fill the pumps. the bottles are quite large so you do not have to refill to often. included in the package are labels so you can choose which pump goes for shampoo or shower gel or soap. i do not use conditioner so i used 3 pumps for shower gels and 1 for my shampoo. the products flow freely once you prime the pumps and so far there has not been a problem in pumping out generous amounts of gel and shampoo. it looks neat and clean in the tub and shower. it can be removed safely by sliding a knife down the back of the unit to disengage the silicone glue strips. it does not come with extra glue so if you were to move it you would have to purchase some silicone glue and about 4 contact strips which can easily be obtained in any store with hardware. i recommend this product highly.\n",

      "i installed this thing about a week ago. overall, very positive. i have a variety of liquids in it, and two are actually very thick. i had no problem priming the thing and getting it going, so even the thick stuff pumps out smoothly, without any issues. as far as mounting goes, the silicon they provided was hardened and fairly useless, only got a little bit out. luckily, i had a tube of rubber adhesive (similar to the silicon, but a bit thinner), which worked fine to attach the plastic base of the unit to the uneven ceramic tile of my shower wall. it is on there solid, and not going anywhere. i have used the silicon type adhesive with another product (adeluxe led fogless shower mirror with squeegee by toilettree products. guaranteed not to fog, designed not to fall. 20% larger than our #1 selling original mirror.i ordered here on amazon) and it works equally well. of course they have not been time-tested, but this method is a heck of a lot better then suction cups. in terms of getting the things off when/if the time comes, i can't help ya there, but others in these reviews have mentioned product that can clean off the adhesive residue from tile. if i have to take these down at some point, it will probably be just to replace them. i am not renting, so i don't have to worry about that.i was pleasantly surprised to find the claims about saving soap/shampoo to be very true. i use a lot less with this dispenser then when squirting directly from the bottle. a few pumps get you going, then an occasional pump to keep the lather going. it's much easier to control, because less comes out with each pump of the dispenser, but i want to emphasize, it is in no way inconvenient or difficult to get enough soap out with quickly with a few pumps-- faster then messing with the bottles themselves or with bar soap for that matter.i got the white plastic, which i am sure will discolor over time, as does almost all white plastic-- but that is just a guess, and i don't really care.i give it 4 our of 5 because of the silicon issue (and if i didn't have any lying around the house, and had to order some more and wait on it, i might have been irritated enough to bump another star-- but that would be unfortunate, because it really is a great product, even if you need to order your own adhesive).conclusion: highly recommend, no reservations!\n",

      "i give this product between 3.75 and 4.0 stars.  there are several good things about this product but a couple of negatives that bring my rating down a notch.pros:*long lasting.  it stays on all day, from morning until night*no flaking, peeling, fading, or smudging.  it stays exactly how you applied it and doesn't give you racoon eyes.*the color is so rich, black, and dark.  the color really makes my eyes pop and gives them that extra oomph.*it dries quickly and doesn't feel wet on your eye lids.*it's affordable and you seem to get a lot of product for the price.cons:*it is somewhat difficult to remove at night.  i use makeup remover and i have to rub at it a little more than i do with other eyeliners to remove it completely.*it is a little difficult to apply in the sense that not a lot of product gets onto the brush to transfer to your lids.  i have to screw the cap on, shake it, and then remove the brush about 3-4 times to get the look i'm going for.  i don't know if i just got an old produt or if the formula is drier because it's waterproof (i think that's the reason), but it's not a huge deal unless you only have a little bit of time to apply this liner.overall, this is a good liner that gives a dark, dramatic color and stays on all day without flaking or smudging.  i found it to be a little difficult to apply and remove at night and had to spend a little bit more effort doing this than i've had to do with other liners.  it's affordable and i'd reccommend it to try, but i'm not sure if i would purchase again; i would probably try other liners before coming back to this one.\n",

      "so it took me a while to decide how well i liked this eyeliner.to start off with, it has a really deep, strong color that doesn't fade, so that was a plus. the consistency of the eyeliner itself isn't too liquidy or goopy... it's a great thickness. i've used this eyeliner for a couple years now, on and off, to line my top lid and do a bit of a wing.here's where things were iffy: after a couple of hours, the eyeliner would crack. it wouldn't smudge or bleed. it would crack. by the end of the day, if i hadn't reapplied it, there would be breaks in what was once a lovely smooth line. i didn't need a makeup remover wipe to take it off, i could practically peel it off. weird!! was it my eye? was it the liner? i determined eventually that 95% of it was caused by the fact that the bottle of liner i was using was old. like, several years old. i knew it was old from the start, but it was an otherwise great liner, so i continued to use it. it wasn't until i bought a new bottle recently that i figured this out. the new stuff will still crack occasionally in small amounts if i wear it for a long time and i guess scrunch my eyes up a lot, but nowhere near the amount it used to.the brush is advertised as tapered but it's not as tapered as i would have expected. it still has bristles; it isn't a triangular foam brush.it is indeed waterproof from personal experience.overall, pretty good eyeliner, at least compared to some other liquid eyeliners i've tried as of late. this is definitely my go-to product and has become my daily liner.\n",

      "if your scalp is itchy, t/gel is worth a try for as long as you are willing to keep using it for a few months. it worked for me but there were no 'instant' improvements. in my case the itchiness went away very slowly but, 3 months later, it's 99% gone.i'm not sure what the exact problem my scalp had but it was itchy like... you know what. it began about one year ago and i couldn't stop myself from scratching which, of course, ensured that my scalp stayed itchy and irritated. discussing the problem with our good family doctor back in october or november (7-8 months ago) did not help much. he had nothing to prescribe but suggested that i massage my scalp with cortisone cream - messy because i have a fully head of hair and i am not planning to shave it - and predicting that the itchiness will get worse in the winter. (thank you doc!)to make the story short, a couple of months ago i stumbled upon a bottle of t/gel left over from the time i used it (effectively) to address a dandruff problem and decided to give it a try. the box claims that this is 'effective from the first use'. it's not. my scalp was still itchy one month later but maybe not as much. and... a couple of weeks ago i just noticed - i wasn't scratching or massaging my head any more. the itch was largely gone.i can't say that the t/gel cured me and it's quite possible that the itchiness would come back if i stopped using it. maybe i will experiment with that in a couple of months but, at this time, i am content and happy to have it at least under control with one weekly t/gel use. yes, it smells a little funny but if you use it before going to bed the smell should be gone by morning.the product deserves my 5 stars because it worked for me. it's possible that it doesn't work for everyone but i can't see how trying it would hurt.____________________________________note: about the smell.the active ingredient that addresses itching and flaking is 'coal tar' which is smelly. neutrogena has patented something they call neutar which is a more refined version of coal tar that doesn't smell as bad as the traditional ingredient. this version of t/gel contains 2% neutar.\n",

      "i have been a sufferer of dandruff ever since i was a child. when i was younger, my head would itch so bad, i would sometimes scratch to the point my scalp would bleed. as i got older, i learned to only wear light colored tops and buy light colored coats and jackets so that my flakes wouldn't be so overt.one day i went to the doctor for a sinus infection and while i was there i asked him what he recommended for my dandruff - thinking he would write a prescription for radioactive kryptonite or something expensive that would turn my hair green.  the doctor said, \"neutrogena t-gel.\" i asked, \"is that a prescription?\" \"no,\" he replied. i was stunned. i had used head and shoulders, selson blue and just about everything else on the market - how would this be different? the doctor was persistent and emphasized that t-gel should work, so i gave it a shot.this stuff has been a life-saver. it's not very glamorous looking - brown, weird smelling shampoo - but just a dollup the size of a nickel is all i need to lather up my entire head - and i have very thick, curly hair.  the longer you let it sit on your scalp, the better - 3 minutes is ideal. despite the unusual smell from the bottle, your hair just smells fresh and clean.unlike other shampoos, i have never had to take a \"vacation\" and use another shampoo to \"liven up\" my hair. t-gel is pretty basic stuff - no perfumes or weird chemicals - the active ingredient, coal tar, is a byproduct from the coal processing industry and this gives it its dark color.  i have used t-gel for almost 15 years now and i never have flakes and i probably scratch my head 3 times a year. about 30% of my hair is now white and silver and i have not had a problem with the shampoo discoloring it.once in a while i will get free shampoo samples in the mail and use other shampoos, but just after 2 hair washings w/o t-gel, my scalp will start itching again.  it seems expensive when you see the price, but one bottle usually lasts me for 3-4 months since you only need a little dab.when i used to color my hair, i used a conditioner for colored hair and it didn't seem to cancel out the effects of t-gel... and after my hair is dry, i use yet another brand of mousse and a hair serum to style my hair - and still, no itching.if you have dandruff and haven't tried t-gel, just give it a try - in one week, you should be symptom free!\n",

      "my two-year old toddler has suffered from bad scalp eczema for most of her life, with scaly itchy lesions that she would scratch to the point of bleeding. i've tried all baby shampoos on the market (johnson and johnson, aveeno, california baby, mustela) and none helped.a few months ago i discovered thatdove bar soap, sensitive skin unscented, 4 ounce, 16 counthad been the main cause of redness and intense itching on her skin, which doctors thought was atypical eczema. after discontinuing dove her skin has mostly cleared up and she no longer itches.i wondered if the detergent (surfuctant) base in most baby shampoos could be triggering a similar response. i knew dandruff shampoos were sometimes recommended for cradle cap in babies, so i tried a small amount (quarter size) ofneutrogena t/sal shampoo, scalp build-up control, 4.5 fl ozon her, left it on for five minutes, rinsed well and reapplied, leaving it on for another five minutes. i thought her curly hair would be a dry frizzy mess but was surprised when it dried and it was very soft and wavy; a dime size dab ofaveeno baby eczema therapy moisturizing cream, 5 ounceworked through her hair and scalp, a spray of water and some scrunching is all that's needed to form ringlets that hold all day. her scalp cleared up in less than a week, and although she isn't cured - it comes back if i don't use it on her -  i'm glad to finally have found a solution.i use t-sal once or twice a week on her, if any scales reappear - otherwise, i usebella b bee gone cradle cap baby shampoo 8 oz. this shampoo is aloe based, hypoallergenic and paraben free, with a light fragrance that hasn't caused any issues. both shampoos have worked well on my other children who sometimes get cradle cap as well.on my end, i am sensitive to fragrances and my hair reacts terribly to strong sulfuctants and silicones found in \"hydrating\" shampoos, causing a huge amount of frizz, dryness, build up and breakage. before trying t-sal on my children, i tried it on my wavy hair. i was also surprised to see how well t-sal cleaned and how soft and light feeling my hair dried afterwards. i've also noticed it helps my hand eczema (from using strong detergents such asdial 1423982 purex ultra free and clear concentrated liquid detergent, 100oz bottle, (pack of 4)), if i leave the shampoo on my hands as long as i do on my hair.i now use t-sal to help remove product build up and alternate withdhs clear shampoo 16 ozanddhs conditioning rinse with panthenol, fragrance free 8 fl oz (236 ml), both very mild no-frills products that work really well.the only thing i don't like is the small size. i've bought a large size t-gel to see if it's more cost effective and will report back after i try it.\n",

      "years ago i used this but i used one rounded tsp 3 times a day along with a healthy diet. i gradually lost 56 pounds and lowered my blood sugar levels, and my cholesterol levels dramatically.since that time i went off of it, returned to my bad ways of eating, regained the weight, and blood sugar and cholesterol went way up again.for the past several months i have once again been taking fiber supplements. i had been taking konjac glucommanan powder and have been very pleased with it. but, i decided to try konsyl again since i can just go to the store and buy it instead of ordering online.i do not like taking the konsyl as well as i like the konjac glucomannan. and, there is some differences in the two fibers. konjac glucomannan is solely a soluable fiber (which will more effectively lower your cholesterol), while konsyl is a mixture of both soluable fiber and non-soluable fiber (the non-soluable fiber helps 'sweet' your colon and creates faster transit, while the soluable fiber lowers the cholesterol but doesn't increase the speed of transit).so, if your transit time is too fast you may want to look more at taking konjac glucomannan. but, if your transit time is too slow konsyl would be better. if you want (more) lowering of cholesterol than konjac glucomannan would be the way to go. if you want faster transit along with cholesterol lowering than konsyl is the way to go.i have decided to alternate using both products; one product at one meal, the other product at the other meal. so, alternating both products should give me the best of both.konjac glucomannan sticks to the side of the glass if you don't mix and drink fast enough, but it goes down smoothe. but, there also is a slightly odd flavor to konjac glucomannan. konsyl is a pretty much flavorless fiber, but has gritty path down that i really don't care for. but, it's not terrible.\n",

      "i don't have severe huge white-head acne, but do have moderate acne where my face is pack-full of bumps everywhere. i have tried every. single. lotion/acne-clearer possibly available on the market from the time i was 13 (i am now 22). to make that search all the more difficult, i am incredibly sensitive skin... the kind where i have to be careful to wash my bedsheets with odor-free detergent. sometimes when putting on shirts (that i wash with a nicely scented detergent) if it touches the side of my face it begins to itch and then i have an allergic reaction in that very spot. i am *that* sensitive. hence, most of the \"guaranteed\" products out there made me face swell up like a red water-balloon literally (proactiv).i don't know the technical term, but i suffer from a vicissitude of extremely dry & extremely oily skin. my chin and lower half of my cheeks and around my mouth get extremely dry, peel, itch, and then if i itch form red spots, etc. i stress all this as i find it extremely important when giving this product the review i'm going to give it.to not digress further, i went to my dermatologist and decided not to use acutane due to the risks, and was put on monodox \"as needed\". when i'm breaking out badly, i take one for 2-3 days consecutively and then stop for about a week and repeat the process. so, this is my explanation to explain my acne condition.as far as moisturizer, i've been so desperate to find the right moisturizer that would help give me that 'soothing' feeling versus itching, stinging, or masking my face with oil. if it stung, it would end up itching after a while, and hence make my condition worse, not better. if it simply felt like a 'masked' feeling in the face, then it simply did absolutely nothing for me and didn't help the dryness at all.this is the one and only topical product i have ever used that's helped me. not only have i found the absolute perfect moisterizer, but for my personal skin condition, it truly does all it states. i *love* the tingly clean feeling! it's like having mint on your face and walking outside on a cool, crisp morning. it has 0 oil. none. i leave it on for hours and it's perfect. the best thing is that it somehow doesn't irritate my capricious face. i was fed up with my face and bought this on a whim. for the first time in my life, i reached for the save.i wish i could give it more than just 5 stars.  very happy customer!\n",

      "after reading that alternating cleansers was better for your skin than using the same one every day, i decided to try this one for every-other-day use. how i use it: put about a nickle sized dollop on my fingertips and rub it into my face, then gently rinse by wiping off with a warm soft washcloth. i often put my face under the shower faucet for a brief 2-3 second rinse after that, too, which i know many skincare professionals discourage, but i find i get a better rinse that way, especially in the area where my face meets my hair.basis is a thinnish gel consistency which feels great to the touch, and has a wonderful scent. it cleans well, though i found it wasn't very good at taking off makeup. for days when i don't wear makeup, it's just fine, but when trying to take off the usual foundation and powder, some was always left behind and i had to grab a second cleanser. for the usual oil, dust, etc., though, it's good.there's a slick feeling to the skin after you use it, which doesn't come off no matter how much you rinse. i wasn't fond of that at first but have come to get used to it. that alone was enough to make me decide not to buy a second bottle.but the biggest problem was for the more delicate skin under and around my eyes. i'm 42 so my under-eye skin has definitely had changes since i was younger, and it's much less able to take a strong cleanser. basis left red patches in the under-eye area near the nose, and though moisturizer helped, there were dry flakes left behind. even if it looked okay at a glance, when i put makeup on it was very noticeable. i avoid that area now and it's all good -- my forehead, chin and nose were the oiliest parts anyway -- but unless your entire face is oily, this may not be the cleanser for you.i'm a little disappointed because the price, the consistency and the scent are perfect, but there are just too many cons for me to buy a second time.\n",

      "i really have only one complaint; so far as i can tell, in essentials, this bar cleanser is much the same as it ever was, but i could swear that the bar i used several years ago was fragrance-free. i know i would never have even tried it if it had smelled like this then. i mean, part of the cetaphil brand's selling point is that its skincare products have no fragrance added to them that would irritate sensitive skin. so why does this cetaphil product have any fragrance at all?i usually have no problems with lightly-scented skincare products, provided they are only lightly scented. i'm fortunate not to have sensitive or allergic skin reactions to fragrance ingredients, but i still have to avoid most of them because for me, strong perfumes set off major migraines. other than that, some of the scents in skincare products are actually quite nice. but this... this was like my worst nightmare of every ancient, long-expired bottle of old-lady perfume dumped into a single bar. it's intolerable. i couldn't even just throw it away; it still stunk up the whole bathroom from the bathroom trash can. i ended up taking it straight outside to the dumpster. and i still had to empty the half-full bathroom garbage to get rid of that sickening, cloying, unbearable scent that sparked off a 2-day migraine.maybe i'm just missing something obvious. i would appreciate it if someone could let me know if cetaphil still makes a fragrance-free bar soap/cleanser. i'd like to go back to using an old favorite, but i can't find the \"old\" favorite.\n",

      "i started using this creme about 6 weeks ago when i realized my 51-year old face needed more maintenance than it was getting.  i'm a florida native with blonde hair and fair skin, so after a lifetime of sun my face had issues with some sunspots and a blotchy complexion.  i don't have problems with breakouts and only have a few faint \"laugh line\" wrinkles that i'm not worried about yet so this review won't address those issues.since i can't afford constant facials i did some research and developed my own skin-care regimen.  exfoliating dead skin cells is important so i decided an aha product would be useful and ordered this creme and began using it most nights after washing my face.  i leave it on anywhere from 10 minutes to an hour and then use an eye cream and moisturizing lotion.  i had some very mild tingling the first time i used it but nothing after that - if you have sensitive skin you might want to try the 8% version first and work your way up to the 10%.after doing this for about 6 weeks i can see a definite difference in my skin that can't be attributed to just the moisturizing.  the sunspots are still there (and always will be) but they are much, much lighter and less noticeable.  the blotchiness has evened out considerably and i feel like i could run up to the store without makeup and not worry about frightening small children.  [...smile...]  as i said, i don't have much in the way of wrinkles so i really haven't noticed whether this has done anything to clear them up or not.  i doubt any skin product will do anything for serious wrinkles anyway, and if that's your worry you'll need to look into some kind of doctor or aesthetician's services.i highly recommend this product for anybody who wants to get serious about taking care of their skin.\n",

      "this is a very cool product. i have dry skin, and i even used to have dry patches on my cheeks, which didn't look good at all, especially with makeup. this creme does make skin much smoother, and much fresher. it is not scented- it has a little bit of unpleasant chemical smell, but it's very faint, and you can't smell it on the skin (and i'm super sensitive to smells).it stings quite a bit when you first start using it, and my skin looked pretty red too, but that doesn't last more than 15 minutes. also, the first week or two after i started using this moisturizer i started to break out a little- that is a temporary effect too. i guess, this is how this stuff works- that must be some sort of cleansing process for the skin. now that i've used this for about a month my skin is much smoother and is much more clear, i can even skip the foundation, but if i do use foundation it goes on nice and smooth.i have been using alph hydrox nourishing cleanser with this. for daytime use, i apply just a thin layer of this creme, wait for about 5-10 minutes, and apply my spf moisturizer, and then makeup (sunblock is  a must after this product, cause aha is an exfoliator, and makes your skin more sensitive to uva/uvb). for night use if my skin feels dry, i sometimes apply some alpha hydrox nourishing night creme (it doesn't contain ahas).i'm not sure if this does much for lines and wrinkles- first, i don't have many, and i haven't used this long enough, but this creme does a wonderful job for dry skin with patches, and for uneven skin, through faster renewal, and dead skin cell removal.i definitely recommend this product, it's a great, truly effective creme, and you can't really beat the price!\n",

      "i waited a long time before writing this review because i wanted to be really sure that this product was working for me.  at first, i was using it along with another product in the alpha hydrox line,alpha hydrox aha souffle 12% glycolic aha 1.6 oz (45 g), and experiencing problems--it turns out that i was sold a container of the souffle that was actually several years old.  whatever the cause, i stopped using the souffle and have been using only the enhanced lotion alone for a few months now, and my skin is looking better than it has in years!!!first, a little background information about me.  i am currently in my early 40s.  as a teen, i had very oily skin but only mild acne problems.  in my late 20s/early 30s, however, i began to experience increasing issues with adult acne.  although the problem wasn't severe, it was quite persistent and recurrent.  i actually went to two different dermatologists and tried various tropical and oral medications with little success.  (the only thing that really worked was accutane, but that became way too cumbersome to continue to use given all of the requirements surrounding prescribing it.)after that, i experimented with using various over-the-counter products, always with mixed results.  more recently, i began doing some reading on alpha hydroxy acids (ahas).  i did a lot of research of various products both here on amazon and on the web site makeup alley, and after my failed experiment with the alpha hydrox souffle mentioned above, i decided to try this product, the 10% enhanced lotion.  i am amazed by the results!  within only a week or two of discontinuing the souffle (which made my skin break out even worse) and using the enhanced lotion alone, my skin was much clearer.now, after using this product daily for about two months, my skin looks great: no blemishes!  i do occasionally get a small pimple or two (usually around the same time in my menstrual cycle), but when that happens, they fade very quickly, leaving no scarring behind.  also, i am starting to notice that the old acne scars i had from before i started using the enhanced lotion are finally starting to fade as well--that is taking longer, but it is happening.i use this product twice a day.  you only need a very small amount, as it is thin and spreads easily over the entire face.  at night, i will apply the product slightly more generously.  (it definitely does sting a bit; this occurs with all ahas.  you can minimize this effect by applying less or trying a moisturizer on top.)  in the morning, i will use only a tiny amount of the product (or sometimes skip it altogether), and on top, i will use olay complete lotion for combination skin with spf 15 - 6 oz., which contains a beta-hydroxy acid (bha; salicylic acid) and also spf, which is important when using ahas because of increased sun sensitivity.  this combination seems to be working well for me.  i haven't really needed much extra night-time moisturization given both that it is summer and that my skin tends to be more on the oily side anyway, but when i do, i have been usingst. ives fresh skin collagen elastin facial moisturizer 10 oz (283 g).i am thrilled to have found a skin care regime that is not only working for me but also consists of very affordable products.  definitely, this enhanced lotion by alpha hydrox is the cornerstone of my routine, and i wouldn't hesitate to recommend it highly!\n",

      "i used this for the first time last night.  my face did sting for about 10 minutes, and then i applied heavy moisturizer over it, and the stinging sensation subsided.  i really liked the way my skin looked this morning.  it looked brighter, and my face had less redness.  i think i might be using too much of this product; a little goes a long way, and i usually apply about a dimes worth to my face and, and i feel it may be overkill.  i sort of like how it makes my skin red initially; it gives me some color, almost like i was in the sun, but a healthy color, not like retin-a red, where it's splotchy and sickly looking.  i hope this product doesn't break my sensitive skin out, but i will update when more time has passed.  i'm using this on alternate days with retin-a cream (both at night before bed), as i have read several places that these two products work well if you use them on alternate days.  i have very delicate skin, and i can only tolerate retin-a twice a week, or i get a lot of irritation and redness (not cute redness either).i used to put lemon juice on my face a few times a week, and this aha cream feels exactly how the lemon juice felt, so i wasn't alarmed.  lemons work great, but they are sort of messy and gross, and i don't like the way it feels on my skin while i'm sleeping.  lemons are incredible for brightening my complexion, but it appears that this aha lotion has the same effect; yay! :)update: i have been using this now for a few weeks, and i really like the results.  i put it on after i wash my face at night, and then put a heavy moisturizing cream on after it.  my skin definitely looks brighter and makeup goes on much smoother.  just make sure that you are exfoliating your skin by washing.  i wash twice a day, once in the morning in the shower, and then at night.  i don't use a wash cloth to wash, because that is too harsh for the delicate skin. i just use my hands and gentle pressure and wash for 1 entire minute.  this makes all the difference in the world.\n",

      "as a lifelong resident of florida, at 51 i have skin that's decorated with many, many sun spots.  my arms and legs are especially affected by the spots and i've been self-conscious about them for years.  i've been very happy with the alpha hydrox cream for my face so i decided to try the lotion on my arms and legs.i've been using it now for about 6 weeks and the change in my skin's appearance is fantastic!  the spots will never go away, but they are much, much fainter and less noticeable.  overall the skin is smoother and softer and just looks and feels much better.i use this most evenings, putting it on my arms and legs while i watch tv.  i wait anywhere from 10 minutes to an hour and then put on a regular moisturizing lotion.  i've read warnings that the aha will cause the skin to be more susceptible to sunburning, so i've been careful to use a body lotion with spf 15 every morning since starting this routine.  i have no idea if the aha really makes sunburning more likely, or if the spf lotion is making any difference, but my skin looks and feels great so i'm happy.if you have sensitive skin and haven't used aha products before you might want to start out with a 8% solution and work your way up, but i haven't had any reaction to this lotion.  if i have a fresh scratch or boo-boo it might sting a little when i first put it on, but that's it.  i very highly recommend this product for anybody who wants smoother, better-looking skin!\n",

      "i am a male in my mid 20s that has been suffering from acne since my early teens. i started using the acne.org regimen many years ago, and found that to be sufficient for the most part. or, at the very least, i thought that my acne was just a fact of life and that the regimen was the best i could do.about a year ago i bought this stuff and for some reason i never used it but once - maybe because it stung a little. but a month ago i had literally the worst acne flare-up i've had in years: something new every day, deep beneath the skin's surface, and it just wouldn't quit no matter what i did. i went searching online for more ideas, and to my surprise, found this on acne.org's website with pretty unanimous acclaim (which is impressive since acne \"cures\" seem to be very hit-and-miss). needless to say, i found my bottle and applied it to the affected areas over night. to my surprise, the very next morning things were looking up: the swollen areas of cystic acne looked somewhat \"deflated\", and places i could feel were about to erupt were no longer feeling that way. over the next couple of days, the situation went from bad to nearly cured.since then - about a month - i've had literally had my longest stretch of acne-free living that i can remember in years. i apply it to spots in the morning and leave it on all day, and apply it to my whole face at night. of course, i always wear sunscreen now and have added a tiny bit of jojoba oil to that to get totally moisturized and protected skin.i haven't even noticed but one or two little pimples try to pop up, and they literally seem to just fizzle and die after applying this stuff. although all acne cures are likely to have different effects on different people, this has been such a miraculous change for me that i just have to recommend it. it's only $10, it lasts a good while, and it may have an incredible effect on your acne situation and your face's glow in general. in addition to being acne free, my scars also seem to be fading and my general skin tone is improved.10/10? i think so.\n",

      "last few months, i've been researching moisturising things, mostly for my hands (but the rest of me too). maybe it's age creeping up on me, or it's my endless washing of hands, but about a year ago i noticed i started to acquire those old-man hands with dried/parched skin, especially on the back of them. so i've been trying all kinds of cremes and lotions (go to my reviews page and see; i've reviewed some of what i've tried). a lot of them help, some more, some less, but amazingly, after all this effort, i was in a drugstore on an unrelated errand, and bought -- on impulse -- a jar of this thing here, cetaphil. i'm not even sure why i did: i've never heard of it before, and i always look for the ingredients to be natural, w/o a chemical factory listed there. well, to be fair, cetaphil isn't bad -- no parabens, no fragrances, no colors. but otoh, it's got some chemistry in it though, alcohols and what not. well, anyway, i got me a jar and tried: wow! it's perfect, better than everything i tried bevor, natural or not natural. it is:1. bland and neutral (no smell whatsoever).2. not greasy at all, not even initially.3. thick but not hard to spread because it's somehow strangely slick, like frozen sour cream i'd imagine would be (except it's not frozen).4. extremely effective: produces even-textured and even-coloured, supple and hydrated skin in one day; does not clog pores; skin stays hydrated at least a day; survives a handwash or even two somewhat (and then, it's easy to reapply if you need, 'cause unlike a lot of other things i tried, it doesn't smell and therefore can be used at the office w/o bothering anyone around).all my researches and expense, and the 100%-adequate answer was sitting on the shelf in my local drugstore (walgreens, thirteen-ninety-nine a jar). who would have known... and it's two to four times cheaper than other thing i tried. i also got the lotion, to compare. i like the creme better (it's more \"substantial\", persistent), but both are good though.bottom line: very highly recommended.ps. one thing i'd like to see that's not available is smaller (portable) packages. i can't go around with this bucket on me, it's too big: it's good for home, but i want a small dispenser in my briefcase. there was a small(er), 8 oz, bottle of lotion available there, but no cream in a small container. for now, i'm stuffing a small amount in a tiny tin from burt's bees hand salve, but it'd be nice if i didn't have to do that.note 1: it's even cheaper in wegman's (like ten bucks, +/-).\n",

      "dermatologists everywhere, including my own, recommend this cream for patients with eczema. the main thing it has going for it is that it is very thick and it contains no fragrance. i've used this cream for years and have never developed any allergic reactions to it, even though several of its ingredients have the potential to cause allergic reactions in sensitive individuals.i decided tonight, for the first time ever, to analyze every one of the ingredients. it's disappointing to see that it has multiple undesirable ingredients thatcetaphil lotionlacks. perhaps the most worrisome ingredient in this skin cream is propylene glycol (see below).ingredients: water, petrolatum, glyceryl polymethacrylate, dicaprylyl ether, glycerin, dimethicone, glyceryl stearate, cetyl alcohol, prunus amygdalus dulcis (sweet almond) oil, peg-30 glyceryl stearate, tocopheryl acetate, benzyl alcohol, phenoxyethanol, sodium hydroxide, acrylates/c10-30 alkyl acrylate crosspolymer, dimethiconol, disodium edta, propylene glycol.petrolatum: this lab-derived substance has been around since 1859 when chemist robert chesebrough developed a method of purifying a black gel that clogged oil rigs called \"rod wax.\" on the plus side, petrolatum seems to reduce water loss from the skin better than any other moisturizer currently known. it is also an effective topical barrier for preventing unwanted liquid substances from invading the skin. premiere examples of the latter use are protecting the skin of babies and incontinent adults from excessive exposure to the ammonia and uric acid (not the same thing as urea) within urine and protecting the skin of serious swimmers from extensive exposure to chlorinated pool water. on the minus side, many consumers prefer not to use a substance derived from petrochemicals on their skin. in addition, as a continual source of moisturizing for the whole body, there is a big downside to petrolatum in that it does not allow the skin to adequately \"breathe.\" that is, it prohibits the skin from a normal, necessary function of absorbing moisture from the atmosphere. as a result, petrolatum can actually be less moisturizing over the long run than emollient substances that allow moisture exchange from the air.glyceryl polymethacrylate: this substance is used in cosmetics to hydrate the skin by increasing its ability to absorb moisture from the air. it is presumed to help heal and reconstruct the dermis layer of the skin and increase skin firmness because it contains elastin.dicaprylyl ether: this is an oil derived from a plant, aka dioctyl ether or cetiol oe. it functions to condition and smooth the skin. it is a non-greasy emollient that spreads easily and is commonly used in non-irritating or \"sensitive\" skin-care products.glycerin: glycerin aka glycerol and glycerine is commonly found in medical and cosmetic preparations. it is used to provide a smooth sensation and as a humectant. it is safe enough to be consumed internally.dimethicone: aka polydimethylsiloxane (pdms): this is a lab-created polymer derived from silicon, a naturally occurring earth element. it is approved for internal and external use. allergic reactions usually occur when exposed to this substance in the form of a powder. they include itchy, burning skin, hives, dermatitis, swelling of the mouth and breathing problems. silicone derivatives act as anti-foaming agents and emollients. they make anything they are in more spreadable. they cause skin and hair to feel silky smooth. they create a protective barrier on the skin that acts as a water repellent, much like petrolatum. they can fill in fine lines on the skin and temporarily smooth out wrinkles.glyceryl stearate: this ingredient is created in a lab by reacting glycerin with stearic acid (a fatty acid obtained from animal and vegetable fats and oils). it functions as a moisturizer, but it can be a skin irritant for people with sensitive skin.cetyl alcohol: a fairly natural oil which is produced by hydrogenation of vegetable oils such as palm oil and coconut oil. it is used in cosmetics as an emollient, emulsifier or thickening agent in skin creams and lotions. in rare cases people with eczema find it a skin irritant, but that may be due to impurities in the cetyl alcohol rather than the cetyl alcohol itself.prunus amygdalus dulcis (sweet almond) oil: very safe, natural oil.peg-30 glyceryl stearate: emulsifying agent. it is a polyethylene glycol ether of glyceryl stearate which is generally considered safe.tocopheryl acetate: this is a form of vitamin e, a safe preservative. it is generally healing to the skin, but some people can develop an allergy to it, resulting in skin rashes, especially around the eyes. in my own case, i am very allergic to pure vitamin e around my eyes, but i have never experienced any allergic reaction to cetaphil cream.benzyl alcohol: this substance is used as a preservative in iv medication solutions and in cosmetics because of its bacteriostatic and antipruritic properties. it is considered very low risk. it is produced naturally by many plants and commonly found in fruits and teas. it is found in many essential oils, such as jasmine, hyacinth, and ylang-ylang.phenoxyethanol: when information about the dangers of parabens became widely accepted, quite a few cosmetic companies switched to this preservative which initially seemed safe. unfortunately, research has begun to reveal that it also may be toxic. many people develop dermatitis from prolonged exposure to it. it can worsen skin conditions like eczema, and there is growing evidence that it may be a xenoestrogen like the parabens.sodium hydroxide: like potassium hydroxide, this is another name for lye. it is used in the paper and chemical industries, for the manufacture of sodium salts and detergents, for ph regulation, and in the production of aluminum. it is used to neutralize acids and increase the alkalinity of whatever it is in. i would presume that is the reason for its use in this product but--lye? really?acrylates/c10 30 alkyl acrylate crosspolymer: this is a lab-derived, white powder appearing in just about every topical cosmetic and medication on the market. it is also used in chewable and sublingual tablets. though considered safe enough to consume internally, like vitamin e, some people develop an allergic reaction with long-term use leading to rashes and swelling (dermatitis). so far, i've never personally developed an allergy to cetaphil so, presumably, i'm not allergic to this ingredient.dimethiconol: similar to dimethicone (see above).disodium edta: this compound is widely used in processed foods and beverages, cosmetics, contact solution and eye drops as a preservative and stabilizer in many processed foods and beverages. when combined with vitamin c and sodium bicarbonate (baking soda), it forms benzene, a dangerous carcinogen. this chemical reaction is most obvious when this compound is taken internally.propylene glycol: this lab-derived compound is a form of mineral oil commonly used in brake and hydraulic fluid and in antifreeze. cosmetic products employ it as a humescent, to prevent the escape of moisture from the skin. unfortunately, the material safety data sheet of the occupational safety and health administration (osha) states that it is a strong skin irritant which can dry the skin. in addition, due to being absorbed into the blood stream through the skin, it can potentially cause kidney damage and liver abnormalities.\n",

      "i was told by my dermatologist that she could only strongly stand behind two products for moisturizing. eucerin and cetaphil. since my skin is so dry, especially in winter and having to be on medications that dried up my skin even more, i have tried both. i think they do an equally outstanding job at ridding cracked, dry, red skin, the thing about cetaphil (specifically the cream in the jar -- not the pump lotion) is that it is not even a tad bit greasy compared to the former. it eliminates dry skin within a few hours. my friend who has to wash your hands eight times a day or so was struggling so much due this winter. both of her children also have hands that look so chapped you would think that they were sunburned. i bought this to give her a sample of as well. she keeps it right on the counter, and is one of the best testimonials of how well this product works. besides its effectiveness, the odorless, nongreasy, tasteless, very thick and potent moisturizer to me is the gold standard for any topical cream that i have ever come across. i use it on scratches that i get very easily during the winter, i use it after shaving, even to calm down the sunburn over aloe & vera. at this price for two jars, it's a steal and depending on how liberal you use it, but jar will last at least a couple of months for one person. just such a great product at a reasonable cost rather than paying an enormous prices for names like avon or oil of ole.\n",

      "i'm a huge neutrogena fan and was perusing their products on amazon when i stumbled across this. i was about to run out of lotion and needed something that could handle how dry and flaky my shins and elbows tend to get - especially now when i'm flying a lot for work.the bottle arrived with the cap broken at the hinge unfortunately. luckily, the oil hadn't leaked out and gotten all over, but it does make storage kind of obnoxious right now, so i'm going to have to steal a cap from an old shampoo bottle or something to replace this one.that aside, the product itself is great!  if i was choosing on fragrance alone, this wouldn't be my first pick, but the smell is very pleasant and is growing on me. instead of rigorously toweling myself dry after my shower, i do a cursory drying, leaving my skin quite damp and then immediately use the oil. it soaks in much better and quicker that way and can proudly say my elbows haven't been ashy in over a week! i do also use this at times on my fully dry skin, and it's still great, just a little more oily feeling at first.this product is defnitely a keeper,. i just don't know how it took me so long to realize this exists!\n",

      "i used to have more of a dry/normal skin type but as normal..skin changes over time, and for me mine has been changing to be more on the oily side and where occasional breakouts have now become a persistent thing. for a while i have already been using cleansers that target acne and didn't see much improvement. it took me a while to realize that maybe it was time i changed my moisturizer too (duh!). my previous moisturizers were those for normal/dry and those that claim to be &#34;for all skin types&#34; (lies!!!!) so this is my first time trying a moisturizer that targets oily/combo skin.i've used this for only 2 days now but i have felt and seen instant results. i truly believe it has helped  keep the oils at bay and in turn keep my acne from continuing to swell or creating more. i was concerned that it would have more of a drying affect and leave any dry spots noticeable, but surprisingly it did not!a lot of pros:*lightweight*unscented*not greasy*not sticky*dries almost a matte finish so you don't look shiny*while it helps to stop the oil from surfacing,  it still keeps your skin very moisturized.i'm pretty impressed with this moisturizer.  other moisturizers tend to leave your skin sticky and shiny but this did not and it just made my skin look like bare, ungreasy, unshiny skin!! (just with pimples that are hopefully leaving soon).in case you were wondering:i use this with the neutrogena deep clean cream cleanser and a murad cleanser that i switch between. also, i find that powder/mineral foundation has helped to add that extra layer of oil stopping fighting power.\n",

      "i bought this cream one winter for dry skin and very drying tap water, but didn't use it very much because i live in a pretty warm climate where  super cold/dry spells are pretty rare. i nearly tossed it when i was moving but decided to keep it, and i'm so glad i did. i use epiduo for my acne, which dried out my combo/dry skin even more and made it very red and sensitive. my entire face, and especially around my eyes, was so painfully dry and flaky. even fragrance-free/sensitive skin creams and lotions still burned and irritated my skin. my skin was flaking so bad during the day from my makeup it was disgusting by the end of the day. i thought i was just going to have to stop using my acne creams altogether, my face was so bad.one night in desperation i pulled this out of the medicine cabinet, and noticed on the back it was non-comodegenic and said you could use it anywhere- lips, eyes, face. i bravely slathered this everywhere, and it was like a miracle for my skin. it didn't burn, there was no fragrance, and it soothed my irritated skin. after a few days of using it morning and night my skin was 200% improved, and my acne has almost entirely cleared up. my acne creams are able to work since my skin isn't constantly dry and irritated, and my skin is seriously glowing from how healthy and moisturized it is now. my makeup goes on perfectly! i use this every night, and sometimes very lightly in the morning if i have a dry spot. it's great on lips and, of course, hands and everywhere else. i carry this with me all the time now. highly recommended!\n",

      "this is much more than a hand cream. it's not really a cream, which initially disappointed me; it's basically a slightly thinner, petrolatum/vaseline-type product. i initially just wanted a fragrance-free creamy hand lotion i could put rub into my hands the same way i would with any other lotion. but this has a slightly different purpose; it's more of a dry skin treatment than a standard lotion-type moisturizer. i found that if i rubbed just a dab on the backs of my hands and on my nails where they can get a rough, ragged and chapped, it softened them up within a matter of a few days. and because it's a little thinner than vaseline, it rubs right in. if it leaves behind any residue, i haven't noticed. i also use it on other dry areas like my elbows and knees without concern that it will come off on my clothes. i have also started using it 2 or 3 times a day on the very rough, dry areas on my feet, including my heels. i spend much of the year barefoot and never wear socks down here in our almost tropical climate. now, with just a few applications, most of the dry areas are basically \"cured,\" and my very dry, cracked heels are close to it. i will have to continue using it as a preventive measure, but it does work beautifully.since the tube size is legally small enough to put in my carry-on on flights and i prefer the fragrance-free version, i can also use it on my face around my eyes and my lips which get dry on long flights. it's basically a multi-purpose product i wouldn't be without and costs no more than a regular jar of vaseline. otoh, if you are looking for something thicker like vaseline, you might find this a little on the thin side. i still recommend trying it, though.\n",

      "just to clarify, here's what this product is not:-this is not lightweight-this is not instantly-absorbing-this is not watery or creamybasically, don't expect the milky, instantly-absorbing hand creams you'd find at places like l'occitane or c&e.; the formula is more akin to stuff like aquaphor, so 'hand cream' might be a bit of a misnomer (this is more of a waxy gel than a cream).be warned--this formula is waxy, thick, and not as easy to spread as runny, milky hand creams. but, it absorbs quickly enough, and application isn't particularly laborious. a little goes a long way.here's why i like it:-non-irritating: i tend to get eczema during dry winters, on sensitive areas of my face/arms (e.g. around my lips, elbows, etc). i've tried tons of creams meant for 'sensitive skin', that only served to provoke already-irritated/dry skin. this stuff has never once irritated inflamed skin.-non-greasy: ok, so this stuff doesn't instantly disappear onto your skin. but, it's not nearly as grossly greasy as products that are mostly petrolatum (e.g. aquaphor, vaseline). if i have an eczema flareup on my face, i don't want patches of shiny grease. thankfully, this stuff is not that.-actually heals dry skin: i visited to numerous dermatologists who all told me \"no idea what causes eczema, nothing you can do except use your topical steroid creams\". it was a vicious cycle: sensitive-skin formulas like cetaphil, cerave, eucerin, etc, only provoked already-irritated skin, and thus couldn't provide much-needed hydration. which made my skin dry. but when i used water, it only further dried out my skin. topical steroid ointments were the only things that worked, until i tried this stuff. it's seriously a life saver!\n",

      "i'm 35 years old (soon to be 36) and i generally stay out of the sun, so i don't have to worry about wrinkles yet!  however, i'd like to keep my skin looking youthful, and i know that i do get some sun exposure just from doing everyday things like walking the dog or driving to work.  also, several older relatives (70s and 80s) have had a basal cell skin cancer on their faces.  i figure if i start working on prevention now, when i reach that age, i'll be less likely to develop the same problem.furthermore, i've been using some rather harsh salicylic acid and benzoyl peroxide treatments lately, and these are drying to my skin.  ideally, i wanted a moisturizer with some sun protection that could also help keep my skin from drying out.  this moisturizer was a quick (i.e., without any research), off-the-shelf purchase at a local drugstore.  i have not used any olay products in the past.this product seems to be doing an excellent job, so far.  while i can't predict what will happen in 5 or 10 years, i'm very happy with the day-to-day benefits of using this moisturizer.  i put this on in the morning before going to work and wash my face again about 10 hours later.  during that time, my face does not look oily at all.  further, i have sensitive skin and i don't notice any redness or irritation.  also, this product does not have a fragrance to it (fragrances are particularly irritating to my skin).  so it truly is good for my sensitive skin.one problem i have often had in the past due to dry skin is that when i dye my hair, the dye gets sucked into my skin and leaves purple stains on my forehead (i have a pale complexion and i dye my hair black).  i end up looking ridiculous for a couple of days.  i've had one hair appointment so far since i started using this moisturizer, and my skin is much less dry -- few to no purple stains on my forehead this time!i also think my skin is pretty soft since i've been using this, and i have not had any additional or unusual breakouts (the package says it is non-comedogenic), so that's nice, as well.  for what it's worth, it's easy to put on makeup (i.e., foundation) after applying this moisturizer.  finally, you should know that a little goes a long way -- it really does not take much to get full coverage of your face; i expect the bottle to last a long time.wow, i don't normally gush about skincare products this much.  i guess this is one of those rare cases when i really can't think of anything i don't like about the product.  at any rate, i'd definitely recommend this moisturizer.\n",

      "ok, so i tried this a few years ago and gave it a thumbs down. well i'm now 50 and in need of some light coverage instead of the more heavy coverage i needed before. a little background on me: i'm half japanese, olive toned, oily t zone area and slight chin acne off and on. i've been using everyday minerals but it's making my skin appear rough and too &#34;made up&#34; for my liking. i did try bb cream (skin79 hot pink) but the color was too light and i am having to mix with another foundation to get a good color. while i looking around i came across this stuff in my old make up bin. thought i'd try it again. well it really does a great job of evening my skin out and keeping my natural skin color. this a big plus. it is really hard to find a good olive color and i tan quite well in the summer and pale out in the winter. it's really a pain for me to find the right color going back and forth mixing colors. this works no matter how dark or light i am. i also struggle with some large pores on my t zone area. this stuff really helps in that dept a lot. though my pores are still there, they are no longer noticeable and i no longer have to use a pore primer! the only thing i use is a light under eye concealer underneath and spot treatment on my chin and then brush it on. another great thing is that this has great staying power.really keeps the oiliness at bay.  i really need that living in texas! it's cheap but not that easy to find but it's big tub so i would imagine it will last a good long time. the smell if not offensive to me at all. it's nice girly smell, not like sulfur or something like that. so i'm changing my mind. for now this is what works for me ;)\n",

      "electronics hobbyists, beware...read on for more.i know that this is an oldie and a well-loved cologne, but i absolutely could not stand it. personally, it would be a 1.5 star rating out of 5. but since i will factor in others' opinions about it, i will give it a neutral 3.i'm a 21 year old college student. i'm quite mature (i've been told) for my age, and i think my colognes tend to reflect it. i have only started getting into colognes recently, so i do not have the best nose. i can't tell you what notes are in each colognes, or what the base is of each one. but i do know what smells good to me and what doesn't. i've currently got ur by usher, chrome, burberry london, 1 million, le male, armani code, and blvgari black in my regular rotation/collection.i tried this cologne the other day, and my initial impression was that it was very strong. the alcohol content of this cologne must be much higher than comparable edts. the only one i have smelled with more alcohol has been nautica blue. the alcohol overpowers the top notes.the dry-down is where it gets interesting. i can swear that hugo smells exactly like breathing in the saccharin-sweet fumes from using rosin-core 60/40 lead solder while chewing 2-hour-old spearmint gum. it's uncanny. and it's not just my skin type. i let several friends and family members borrow it, and i smelled exactly the same thing on them. soldering fumes and gum. i did notice that, for my friends and family that have never soldered anything before, they found this scent to be quite pleasant. however, anyone i knew that had soldered anything before or has been around someone else soldering knew the smell without me having to tell them anything.i haven't ruled out the possibility that i got a bad bottle/batch. i will certainly give it another try if i see it in a dept store. so although this is a classic frag, beware. try it out before you buy it. especially if you've ever soldered anything before and you didn't enjoy the fumes. it's definitely a unique scent.\n",

      "i used this dye on my sister who dyes her hair red a lot. she's currently out of work (recently had a baby) and hadn't dyed her hair in months (pregnant), so we decided it would be fun to do. she chose this color because it's a bit deeper than she normally does, and she wanted to have a more intense red than she can get away with at work while she doesn't have to work. our plan was to use this and use something like manic panic over some pieces to make them even more red (which we've done before with her usual reds, and it always works out well), but this came out soooo dark it looks black until it's in the light. it's like purple-red black. it's lightened up after a wash or two, but still much darker than she anticipated. we didn't even bother with step 2, adding manic panic over sections, because we know it's so dark it won't make much of, if any, difference. it's a nice color, but not anything like it looks on the box. she's very fair (like me, which you can see in some of my other reviews of hair dyes i've used personally), so it's a much starker contrast than she anticipated.that said, the dye itself works well, processes quickly, and wasn't overly damaging to her hair. the shampoo/conditioner combo that comes with it seems to be working well for her also (she has very long, thick, curly hair). the dye starts out a deep cherry red which lead us to originally believe it would be much brighter than we expected, but it then turned purple-ish as it processed.\n",

      "deep copper shimmer:i've been too afraid to use an at-home dye, so i've been forking over hundreds of dollars for salon color. i finally decided to try l'oreal 74 deep copper shimmer instead. it was the first time i have ever dyed my hair by myself, and it was easy! there is more than enough product for a test strand and then someone with long (though not thick) hair. my hair looks just as good as it does when i have it done in the salon and feels incredibly soft. the color is exactly what it shows on the box, even at my dark brown roots! i highly recommend this. l'oreal--please don't ever discontinue copper shimmer! the color is outstanding!champagne cocktail:note: this review is for l'oreal feria 91: champagne cocktail. i am going to cover in this review what i desperately needed to find before i tried this product and couldn't.hair type: colored blonde with reddish-blonde roots from a salon; previously highlighted blonde from being dyed red. hair is thick and goes past shoulders to the end of the shoulder blades.when i dyed it with feria: 5 weeks after last salon visit, on unwashed hair; 1 box of dye was all i needed.review: i love being a blonde but was considering going brunette to save on money and salon costs, which in the area i live are upwards of $100 at almost any salon (unless you want your hair cut by someone fresh out of beauty school--which, no offense, is too nervewracking for me personally). then it occurred to me--perhaps i could try highlighting or coloring myself from home. i used to color my hair red (the l'oreal copper shimmer) and i got so good at doing it that i did a better job than my stylist. if you're unsure about doing it yourself, check out youtube for kandee johnson's how-to-dye-hair video. this is the video that taught me how to dye my own hair in a professional manner.after comparing brands, i went back to l'oreal, as i already trusted the line and it had the best reviews. i chose champagne cocktail based on the l'oreal \"find my color\" walkthrough; i chose a cool blonde since i have pink tones to my skin and my hair (being dyed red for so long) has a tendency to lift red. i did a strand test, even though the instructions do not say to do so. i wanted to be sure that my hair would not lift extremely red (no orange for me, though i did like being a ginger in the past.)i left the color on my roots for 25 minutes and then covered the rest of my hair for 10 minutes. my roots are still slightly darker and redder than my lengths (roots are strawberry blonde, and lengths are very pale blonde), so i would probably leave it on longer the next time i refresh my color; i think i will strand test my roots for 25-45 minutes and see how that works out.i am pleasantly surprised at how this dye came out; my hair is very soft after saturating with the conditioner, and i will probably use it again. however, tomorrow i think i will try the l'oreal brass banisher to see if that can cut some of the strawberry blonde out of my roots. hope this helped someone!editthe brass banisher cut the red out of my hair! i don't have to go to a salon to get my roots to match, and i don't have to bleach them. for full review, go to the banisher product page.\n",

      "first, you absolutely must know your range of tones for your skin. do not colour your hair prior to that discovery or you will end up with the wrong colour.next, if you are attempting to go from blond to black, you must use a filler. with that said, hair colouring does require prior knowledge. also, often times, it takes multiple applications for colour to grab well. that means you may need to colour repeatedly to get the deepest and darkest colour result. as well, a multi-faceted colour product means that it will not deposit colour evenly. that is the entire point of the multi-faceted colour product, it grabs here & there.**to prevent colour from fast-fade do this; after you colour, gently rinse hair, add a conditioner treatment, and do not wash with shampoo for 2-3 days. this helps to set the color better and prevent quick fading issues.also if you use a lot of styling products, do not attempt to colour over hair that is coated with styling product, it will not work-out properly.lastly, do not experiment without prior knowledge of hair colour. seek a professional for a first time colouring, and then, you can attempt to maintain that same colour, after the fact, on your own. and stay within your range of tones such as cool versus warm.example: if you have fair skin (veins appear bluish under skin) and blue eyes then you have cool tones. if you have hazel eyes and pale-peached, golden toned skin (veins appear greenish under skin) you are a warm tone. hope this helps people in regards to making mistakes with hair colour.\n",

      "i love this color when ever i decide to do black. this color is more of a blue black than a bright shiny black. the mixture turns a dark blue color when applied and developed. although for feria's version of blue black the color is still very shiny looking. you will not get a dull black using this brand and color. if your looking for more of a natural black or a jet black then you would definitely want to stay away from this color. instead try using the color black leather for a more natural looking black. i love blue black hair for my \"scene\" styled hair the two looks go perfect together when doing \"scene\" styled hair in a black color. there will always be some fading when using a hair color but with feria i find that it fades only a little and its no big deal to do a touch up every once in awhile. in all my years of using this brand i have always been satisfied with its results. this color works best on medium brown to dark brown hair to start for a more deep and darker black with a hint of blue for an undertone. usually when starting with to much of a darkest brown to black color the blue will not always be noticeable using \"any\" brand which i have had that experience before too. in my opinion the color is very pretty and the brand never fails. when using dyes remember to always wash and rinse hair in lukewarm water to cold water to help keep colors from fading/bleeding. especially when rinsing the dye itself out during application time. they tell you to rise the color out until water runs clear (do not do that) this step i do not do. i rinse about 10% of the color mixture out then use the conditioner and rinse some more. your having to rinse your hair twice which helps fades color faster in its beginning process which can make hair seem faded faster and will fade easier. so don't rinse most of the color out during its initial application which is the most important in my opinion and it works for me. that way you still have a tiny bit of color left in your hair enough to extend the color and penetrate to keep your hair rich in color until you wash your hair for the first time. after dying i don't wash until a week to a week and a half later.\n",

      "let me start by saying, i am a first time hair colorer. within the last 2 years i have been through some extremely stressful life-changing events that have caused my hair to begin to gray despite my age. i never thought i'd be gray before i turned 30! needless to say, i tried to pluck them until i realized i couldn't keep up. then i tried to accept them. then i thought, why the heck am i putting up with this?! i'll have the opportunity to \"gray gracefully\" when i'm 60! so i picked this up at a local store after a recommendation from friends, and proceeded to agonize over a color choice. my hair is naturally a medium to dark brown and i wanted a color that was similar to my own, perhaps slightly lighter, just to cover my gray and add a little dimension. i chose this color (medium brown) because it seemed the closest to my natural color. nowhere on the box did it say this color was auburn or red or anything of the sort! so imagine my surprise as my hair starts to dry and my roots are red! the rest of my hair was lightened slightly and did come out a lovely medium brown with hints of red, but my roots are lighter than the rest of my hair which makes the red more noticeable. it's definitely not a horrible thing. i like it and aside from the initial surprise when i saw the red, i am pleased with how it came out. i just thought it was necessary to let other ladies know that this most definitely is red, despite what the box says.that said, being my first time coloring my hair (and doing it completely by myself, no less) i was a little anxious but the process was incredibly simple. i picked up a few tips from videos on youtube and covered the floor in newspaper, put oil on my skin just beyond my hairline to avoid staining my skin, and wore a towel on my shoulders. the process was as simple as mixing the solution and applying it evenly throughout my hair. if you have dark hair already, it would be hard to mess this up. i've heard it can be tough to color blonde hair on your own, so i'd advise not choosing this color as a blonde unless you're prepared for a lot of red. if it turned my dark brown into red, i can only imagine what it will do to a blonde!regarding the gray, i was aware beforehand that it can be challenging to cover gray. this color did hide the vast majority of my gray though i can pick out a few areas where the hairs are quite a bit lighter than the rest. i realized right away that these were my gray hairs that did pick up the color but did not come out as dark as the rest of my hair. it's all good to me, though, because the gray is gone! it actually looks like very subtle natural highlights and i like the effect. just be forewarned that this product is not going to completely blend away your gray and give all your hair a uniform shade. i would probably advise against using this particular color if you're heavily grayed. i am only about 5% gray but it was enough to bother me and i am much happier with my hair now! overall, i was very pleased with the product's simplicity and the final result, but please choose another color if you're not looking for red in your brown. :)\n"

      "this is the best boxed blonde i have ever used.i've been bleaching my hair in various ways for ten years now. i've tried every boxed brand under the sun, i've gotten highlights, i've gone to the salon, and i've even had my friend bleach it (she went to aveda). this has been the best product thus far.my hair is long and naturally a dark dirty blonde color, though it has years of different bleaches in it. this is the only boxed hair color i've used that has actually given me close-to-white results. it will always be a little bit yellowy (just a bit more golden than what's pictured on the box) but i'm sure you could really knock out any brass with a good purple-blue toner. i have not had any issues with brassiness using this brand, though. and that's amazing, considering i used to have rust-colored stains in my hair all the time when using other brands and no amount of toner would help. i also only need one box to touch up my roots, which i do every 4 months or so, since my hair is pretty damaged from previous experiences.and the best part is, this stuff doesn't reek or burn or itch like an ammonia-based color does. normally, i have to leave the bathroom several times during a coloring session and seek fresh air outside, but that's not the case with this! i also only leave it in for about 20 minutes for fear of causing breakage but i still get a great color out of it.the conditioner that comes with it is also good, but as previously mentioned, my hair is damaged (and dry), so i tend to use the entire tube of conditioner after coloring. this ensures that my hair actually feels healthier immediately after coloring and i see less breakage.all in all, i would highly recommend this to anyone considering going blonde. take it from me, a ten-year expert on do-it-yourself dying.(but i'll warn you. if you have really dark or reddish hair, i'd recommend going to a professional. it will probably turn out orange if you try doing it yourself.)\n",

      "i have no real idea what all the one star reviews saying &#34;black&#34; are for other than they did it wrong because there is a special process to make red from a box come out right, and if you don't follow it no matter the brand you get a darker or horrid red shade.first i didn't use it on dark hair, that is the key. if you hair is dark strip it down and use a soft red or very soft honey blonde to as a base. then the next day apply the red dye, and only leave it on 1/2 to 3/4 the time it actually requires. rinse it twice, and then use color treated conditioner on it, not just the one in the box. it is a long story but in short the chemicals in pre-boxed dye for red don't always mix well with previously treated hair or dark hair pigments.product reviewthe item was pricey compared to other brands, but i haven't found another brand that gives me the deep rich red shade i wanted. it wasn't as light a red as the box, no, but it did turn out well. i also use test strips when i try a new product to avoid disaster in case the product doesn't work right.it does come out blood red and stain everything so put some lotion around the edges of our face, on your shoulders and neck, and your hands so it will wash out easier. put down towels you don't love because it is going to make on heck of a mess and is nearly impossible to get off anything with using harsh stripping chemicals, learned that the hard way.positives-easy to use-firm red color (at least that was what i got on my hair)negatives-fades fast-comes out black if you do it wrong, and it is easy to do red hair dye from a box wrong-price tagall in all, i would buy it again, however i lean more toward the next shade of red down.\n",

      "i felt compelled to review this as i've just used it for the first time. i am a veteran home-colorer...been doing blonde in various shades for 15 years, and yes i still have hair left. first of all, don't even try mixing this in the teensy bottle they provide. get an old bowl or a color mixing bowl. and if you have hair even past your collar bone, get two boxes. the consistently is thick, which is great for not dripping but not great for evenly applied color. you're going to need a lot to saturate your whole head if that's what you're doing. this is a nice alternative to bleaching, yes. but with drawbacks. if you have hair darker than dirty blonde, you're going to get brassy results no matter what you do. only with extensive bleaching using a high volume peroxide solution will you get snowy white locks. i started with dirty blonde today, and my hair is a very, very light blonde now. i used the violet-tinted conditioner provided, and left it on my head for about 20 minutes which did counteract some brassiness i was left with. i'd recommend using a violet tinted shampoo and conditioner for maintaining your blonde and keeping brass toned down, especially if you have hard water. you can make your own purple or blue tinted conditioner by adding some manic panic or jerome russell dye to a large amount of cheap conditioner.if you found this review helpful, please click 'yes'...thanks!!\n",

      "i bleached my hair to a mostly yellow, slightly orange color and then applied this product to take it to the next level, to the color i wanted my hair to be. instead, my hair is yellow-blond. don't get me wrong, it's a nice color, just not the one i was hoping for. for that reason, i would say it's not worth the time or money. however, i gave it 2 stars because the conditioner it comes with is fantastic! it's a nice purple anti-brass conditioner that works like a miracle at toning brassiness (to some degree anyway...)and leaves your hair feeling healthy and smelling like heaven. but other than that, i'm disappointed with my result and i'm sure it's human error to some degree but i wasn't that far off and expected the tone of my hair to cool somewhat to be closer to what was on the package. will not purchase again.\n",

      "i read up on this before buying it from my local cvs. i had been wanting to go ombre for a while and this is one of the only kits could find. i didn't want it that bad that i was willing to shell out a ton of money to pay for it to get done in a salon, and i'm pretty good with my own hair so i thought i'd give it a try.i have medium/dark brown, which i've never bleached, highlighted or dyed (beyond demi-permanents that only slightly alter my color). i got it trimmed recently, so it was pretty healthy looking with only a few split ends right before i used this kit. i have very thick hair, and the bottom layers are especially dark. i do like the color of my hair, so i figured with the color being stripped down and lightened... how bad could it actually be?i was concerned and super nervous about this, especially because of all the negative reviews, and because i've never seen what my hair looks like bleached before... but i do really like the way it turned out. the last time i colored my hair (temporarily) was about 2 months ago with a demi-permanent dye that is about a shade darker and much more red than my natural color. i thought that they dye had entirely washed from my hair by now, but i could see some strawberry pigment after i used this kit.this kit itself is pretty user-friendly. i was actually very surprised with how well the brush worked with achieving the gradient look rather than the &#34;oh man, girlfriend has some super bad roots, she should get that fixed&#34; look. obviously you need to be careful about how and where you apply it to make sure the application remains consistent on both sides, and do some lighter brushing closer to the top to make sure you get that fade. i also made sure the ends of my hair were super saturated. i would recommend starting with the darkest part of your hair (so that develops for the longest time) and ending with the lightest parts (so that develops for the least amount of time). you also have to be careful about over-brushing with the brush in the kit, and apply the bleach quickly. if the bleach starts to dry, you're going to have to yank through the strands, and yes, the bleach could damage your hair. that's the nature of the chemical. stick to very small sections of hair (3-inch sections max) so you can work quickly to get the bleach in before it starts to dry, leaving you with more tangles and breakage the more you try to pull the brush through it. i stuck to the 45 mins max total time (per the included instructions), and my hair does not look unhealthy, fried, dry, etc., but like i said before, it was pretty healthy to begin with. i showered immediately after and let my conditioner sit in for a solid amount of time.i like the way my hair looks, but i can see how this would be an issue with anyone who has any kind of dye in their hair, especially if it's semi-permanent and they had it done in the last 6-9 months. if i were to guess, most people who gave negative reviews or this product either 1. didn't apply it correctly. 2. didn't let it process for the correct amount of time, 3. didn't like the color of their hair once bleach was applied, 4. had colored their hair recently enough that it would affect it, or 5. had unhealthy/dried out hair that just didn't take to the bleach very well. i was just lucky enough to have the stars align with my current hair conditions, and the kit worked well with what i have.i gave it four stars for a few minor reasons: because the gloves that came in the box were super flimsy, and because the bleach just didn't work as well with my my darkest hair.overall, i think this is a great kit as long as you are careful, don't have a lot of previous dye jobs, remember to deep-condition your hair afterward, and are willing to tone your ends if you are unhappy with resulting color the bleach leaves behind. just be smart, follow the instructions, and be kind to your locks. good luck!\n",

      "the label on the box said \"deep bronzed brown.\" i love anything bronze; it looks great against my yellow toned fair skin (although, there is some red creeping in there).i've been coloring my own hair for a number of years. when i used to lighten it, i went to a pro. but now that i am merely adding or slightly adjusting my own shade, there are too many products available that do as well, if not better than salon results i've had.even so, i used to sometimes pick a shade that looked great on the box, but then turned too dark for my tastes. my hair is naturally darkish medium brown. i'd tried some brownish red shades recently - and finally decided that those were not for me.i didn't, however, want a flat, mousy brown color. i wanted it to look natural, with some highlights. when i saw the l'oreal feria #45 french roast / deep bronzed brown and fell in love with the color - i still wondered -- will it even look close to that on me? i stood in the aisle for quite some time, weighing the odds. staring at those little color boxes. then i decided to take the plunge!when it was time to rinse the color out, i was nervous about what it would look like. would it be flat and dark? so i decided that since the light in my bathroom always makes my hair look darker than it is - i would quickly turbin wrap my head and not look at it until i could see it in the window where more natural light pours in.  i did sneak a peak, just at the top of my head.... and i liked what i saw!i ran with a hand mirror to the kitchen, the only place in this depressing little apt. (that i will soon be leaving, thank god) to get a good look. i almost could not believe my eyes. it looked just like the box, highlights and all!i could not be happier with my results from this product. so much so, that i will point l'oreal to this review. they deserve to know how i happy i am. and so do you, which is why i am writing this.i cannot attest to whether it will look the same on you - but i should tell you about my hair. it is extremely fine, but there is a lot of it. in fact, hairdressers used to be shocked at how thinned out it looked wet. i have very little gray, so much so that i can go for months without coloring if i want. but i like to refresh the color every month, in any case. and i do not wash my hair every day. more like 3-4 or even (gasp!) an entire week, in winter.my skin tone is fair-medium with yellow undertones that often appear reddish. my eyes are an amber brown.so -- i can honestly say that this is one of the best hair color products i have ever used. and i have practically used them all! i would say, if you like this color. go ahead and try it. you probably will not be disappointed -- in fact, more like delighted!\n",

      "i tried this product because i wanted to try a new look for summer.this product pretty much worked like it said it would -i'd say that this lightened my hair about 2 shades (it says up to 3 on the box), although it ended up with a pinkish tone to it. no problem, though -as long as it's not rusty i'm ok with that.i have medium-dark hair though (i'm half japanese, half white). my hair is more on the asian side, very straight and thick.this is a \"cool tone\" color that says it will minimize orange/reddish tones, and it looks good. it's not exactly what it looks like on the cover picture (and unfortunately i didn't end up with that gorgeous creature's face, either).i have grays here and there, and it didn't really cover them at all. not that i expected a lightening product to, but i thought i'd just note that here. i'm not really sure if this is a color dye, a bleach, or both...i didn't expect it to cover completely but since my hair is lighter, they're less noticeable.the directions state that the user should apply it on the main part of the hair and the ends first, wait 20 min. and then apply it to the roots and wait 10 min. this was a little confusing to me, as there is no way that the user can completely avoid the roots when applying. i did my best though and it worked out for me. the conditioning stuff that is put on at the end needs to be applied every week afterwards and they say not to shampoo the next day after using it to retain the color.it was really easy to use and fast.too bad i have to color my hair every 3 weeks b/c it grows fast...this stuff retails for $10 in most stores but it's still cheaper than a couple of trips to the salon.\n",

      "the r57 is such a lush red color. it looks a bit darker than what's on the box (more like the color at her roots), but that may be because my hair has been previously bleached. i still like it, its even better looking than the box! before using the loreal feria, i had tried the garnier olia, which ruined my hair. olia is crap in a box-it will fry your hair like nobody's business, and the color lasts exactly three shampoos. anyway, i purchased the feria to try and cover over the damaged and faded olia. the feria did a great job, coloring my multi-shaded and faded hair a deep, uniform auburn color with highlights here and there. i also add jojoba to my conditioner, which is excellent for dry, damaged hair. it has lasted longer than any red box dye, and even longer than some salon colors. in the directions, it says to shampoo hair twice when rinsing out the red dye-i didn't do that. i just rinsed it. this color will continue to bleed down the drain and onto your towels, as any red dye does, but it just has a staying power that most reds don't have. always use cool water, as cold as you can tolerate, on your red hair.i am trying to find a more natural red henna dye, and tried one from mendahi on a sample of my hair, but have had no luck with that. i used only one box, and my hair is fine, dry, and to the bottom of my shoulder blades. i also don't use shampoo. once or twice a week, i dissolve a tablespoon of baking soda in a cup of tepid water (make very sure it's dissolved, or you will end up with white granules remaining in your dried hair!). i wet my hair in the shower, pour this into my roots, massage, rinse, and condition with 100% pure coconut conditioner mixed with jojoba oil. the first time you sub the baking soda for shampoo, you might not love the results. just try it once or twice more; i did, and my roots are silky soft and very clean. it's also been kinder to my red color, which has the largest dye molecule, making it the most difficult color to maintain.update! please use henna instead of chemical haircolor, it's such a better option!my hair is overprocessed, i have been bleaching it for years and had dyed it red with a box dye a few months ago (loreal r57 cherry crush).  my hair was breaking, falling out like crazy and i am trying to eliminate chemicals from all of my beauty products, and typical box hair dye is overloaded with nasty toxins.i was afraid to try henna, because people will tell you that your hair will turn orange-its not true! henna has saved my hair and i have never received so many complements! i ordered the burgandy 100 gram from henna guys, they have a website and sell here on amazon, and it provided me with two applications (my hair is past my shoulder blades).  i mixed half of the package with water and a plastic spoon (no metal!), put it in an empty jumbo hair dye applicator bottle from sallys, and applied it. it was so easy! it's not even messy, just make sure you have a damp washcloth handy to wipe up spills on your face or sink immediately.  i saturated my hair, wrapped my head up in saran wrap, and went to sleep. i left it in for 11 hours, then washed it out and conditioned it.  when it was dry, it had a bit of a brown orange tone, so i prepared the remaining mix, added a raw egg, and reapplied it on my hair.  i left it on for five hours, heated it with a blow dryer for about five minutes, then washed it out.  remember that henna takes two days to fully develop, so be patient.  it looked good when i washed and dried it, but wow, it looked even better two days later! it has a gorgeous deep burgandy tone, its shiny and soft, and i have not had a bad hair day since! my scalp does not itch like it does after using chemical dyes, and it looks so rich and healthy! i am so in love with henna, i just can even describe the difference that it has made!  i will forever be faithful to this henna brand! customer service is so helpful, and will respond quickly to any questions about the product.  henna is addictive! i am trying the blend of burgandy and deep red next! love it! remember that if you aren't getting the deepness of color you want, or it looks orange, henna it again and again until you achieve the color you want! also, if your hair has been bleached in the past, as mine has, it does take more reapplications to keep the color.  it's just something you have to live with until the bleached portion of your hair grows out and you can cut it off.  henna is excellent for controlling oily scalp, which was not a problem of mine, but would be very beneficial for some people.  i didn't have any problem with the smell that some people comment about, and even though i left it on for over 11 hours, i did not get a headache.*i have added a picture of my hair with the feria.  you can find it on the main product page, scroll way down toward the bottom and you will see it on the right. i did not have my flash on, so it appears a bit darker than it actually was.\n",
