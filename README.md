# BigDataProject
Towards the completion for the course Big Data

In this project we have planned to create a recommender system for Amazon product recommendation system according to customers ratings (the dataset is available on Kaggle). This project will emphasis on the association rule for the products. After proper analysis and preprocessing of the dataset we will implement two algorithms from supervised learning that will be discussed in class. Later, we will analyse the difference between the two approaches and different results that are obtained.
